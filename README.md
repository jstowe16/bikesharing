# 201908 Citi Bike Bikesharing Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to use Tableau to visualize bike-sharing data to support the Boise start-up efforts. Data from the Citi Bike bikesharing database were utilized in this analysis. Specifically, data from August of 2019. In order to assist the Boise start-up, the objective of the analysis was to:
+ Identify how long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
+ Identify how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
+ Provide a breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
